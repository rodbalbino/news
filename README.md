# NEWS SAMPLE

## A simple [Responsive](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Tools/Modo_Design_Adaptavel) Vanilla JS [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/Web_Components) with [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) and [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker) application

Built entirely on top of HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and native browser APIs. There are no libraries or frameworks involved. Extremely fast and functional.

For this example I used [NEWSAPI](https://newsapi.org/) for development. If you want to use it, you must also place a valid API_KEY in the **_newApi.js_** file.

For my local tests I also used [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) as a local web server. But you can choose the one you prefer.
